# TurkishTextFormatter
This script is designed to process a JSON file and convert Turkish text according to case rules. It prompts the user for language selection and file path, checks for errors, and displays relevant messages. A specific function applies Turkish case rules, but it cannot correctly convert the name "Ä°stanbul" to "Istanbul."
